            <p>Hi! I'm Fawwaz Rifai, a 15-year-old high school freshman who currently lives in Indonesia.
                Coding has been one of my favorite hobbies in this pandemic.
                To be honest i started to learn coding in backend languages like python about 5 years ago, but back then i didn't quite take programming seriously.
                To legitimately devote my free time on useful stuff, i decided to teach myself into becoming a frontend web developer. Even though the journey was demanding, in the end i could do all the things i had aimed for which had effected in very indulging results.
